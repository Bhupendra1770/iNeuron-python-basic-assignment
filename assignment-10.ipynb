    "### 1. How do you distinguish between shutil.copy() and shutil.copytree()?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: shutil.copy() will copy a single file, shutil.copytree() will copy an entire folder and every folder and file contained in it."

    "### 2. What function is used to rename files??\n",
    "Ans: 'os.rename()' function is used to rename files or directories using a python program, this function takes two arguments 'src' and 'dest', 'src' represents the name file/directory which we want to rename, whereas 'dest' represents the new name of the file/directory."

    "### 3. What is the difference between the delete functions in the send2trash and shutil modules?\n",
    "Ans: Shutil module provides a funciton called as 'shutil.rmtree()' which deletes a directory and all its contents. The other functions with similar functionality are 'os.remove()' removes a file, 'os.rmdir()' removes a empty directory. The problem with these functions is once a file is deleted. it will be lost permanently, if a file is deleted accidentally using these methods there is no way we can recover the deleted file\n",
    "\n",
    "Where as send2trash module provides a function called 'send2trash.send2trash()' to delete a file/directory. these methods moves the files/directories to trash folder instead of permanently deleting them. hence if a file/folder is deleted accidentally it can be still recovered from trash folder."
