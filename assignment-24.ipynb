    "### 1. What is the relationship between def statements and lambda expressions ?\n",
    "Ans: Lambda Function, also referred to as 'Anonymous function' is same as a regular python function but can be defined without a name. While normal functions are defined using the def keyword, anonymous functions are defined using the lambda keyword. However,they are restricted to single line of expression."

    "Ans:Function annotations are arbitrary python expressions that are associated with various part of functions. These expressions are evaluated at compile time and have no life in python's runtime environment. Python does not attach any meaning to these annotations.\n",
